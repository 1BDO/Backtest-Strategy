# Backtest Strategy

This project provides a comprehensive suite of Python scripts for backtesting various algorithmic trading strategies. It allows traders and developers to test the performance of different approaches using historical data, enabling informed decision-making before live deployment.

## Overview

The "Backtest Strategy" project offers a flexible framework for evaluating trading strategies across different market conditions. By leveraging historical data and popular financial libraries, it helps in understanding strategy profitability, risk, and overall effectiveness through detailed performance metrics and visualizations.

## Features

*   **Delta Trading Algorithm Backtester:** A robust backtesting script for a specific Delta trading algorithm. It includes features like historical data fetching via `ccxt`, technical indicator calculations (Moving Averages, ATR), sophisticated entry/exit signal generation, position sizing based on the Kelly Criterion, trade simulation, and comprehensive performance analysis with plotting capabilities.
*   **Trend Following Strategy:** Implements a classic trend-following strategy using multiple moving averages and session high/low breakouts. This strategy is backtested using the `backtesting.py` library and includes configurable stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.
*   **VWAP Trading Strategies:** Contains two variations of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. A basic VWAP strategy demonstrates entries and exits based on price interaction with VWAP, while an enhanced version integrates Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Average True Range (ATR) for improved signal filtering and risk management.
*   **Multi-Indicator Strategy:** A custom backtesting script that combines Supertrend, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and VWAP indicators. This strategy showcases more complex trading logic derived from the confluence of multiple technical signals.
*   **Historical Data Integration:** Seamlessly connects with various cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Delta, Binance) using the `ccxt` library to fetch accurate historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
*   **Performance Analysis & Visualization:** Generates detailed statistical summaries of backtest results, including profitability, drawdown, and trade statistics. It also produces interactive HTML plots and static PNG images to visualize price action, indicator overlays, and trade entries/exits.

## Prerequisites

Before running the backtest scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **pip** (Python package installer)

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and analysis of historical market data.
*   **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations within the strategies.
*   **CCXT:** A powerful library for connecting to and trading with cryptocurrency exchanges, used here for fetching historical data.
*   **Matplotlib:** Utilized for generating static plots and visualizations of backtest results in `backtest.py`.
*   **`backtesting.py`:** A robust framework for backtesting trading strategies, providing features like strategy definition, trade simulation, and performance reporting.
*   **`pandas_ta`:** A technical analysis library that provides a wide range of indicators used across various strategies.

## Setup or Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/backtest-strategy.git
    cd backtest-strategy
    ```

    *(Note: Replace `your_username/backtest-strategy.git` with the actual repository URL.)*

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy ccxt matplotlib backtesting pandas_ta
    ```

## Environment Variables (Applicable)

Some scripts might contain placeholders for API keys (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`). For production or repeated use, it's highly recommended to manage sensitive information like API keys using environment variables for security. You can set them in your system or use a `.env` file and a library like `python-dotenv`.

Example of setting an environment variable (for Linux/macOS):

```bash
export DELTA_API_KEY="your_actual_delta_api_key"
```

Or for Windows (Command Prompt):

```bash
set DELTA_API_KEY="your_actual_delta_api_key"
```

And then access it in your Python script:

```python
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv('DELTA_API_KEY', 'YOUR_API_KEY_DEFAULT_IF_NOT_SET')
```

## Usage Example

To run a backtest, you can execute any of the strategy scripts directly. For instance, to run the Delta Trading Algorithm backtest:

```bash
python backtest.py
```

This will fetch data, run the backtest, print performance statistics to the console, and generate a plot (which might be saved as `backtest_results.png`).

To run the Trend Following Backtest:

```bash
python "Trend Following Backtest.py"
```

This will likely generate an HTML file (e.g., `backtest.html`) with interactive plots of the backtest results.



## FAQ

**Q: How do I change the cryptocurrency symbol or timeframe?**
A: Open the respective Python script (e.g., `backtest.py`, `Trend Following Backtest.py`), and you will find configuration variables at the top of the file, such as `SYMBOL`, `TIMEFRAME`, `EXCHANGE_ID`, etc. Modify these values directly.

**Q: Can I backtest with different exchanges?**
A: Yes, the scripts use `ccxt`, which supports many exchanges. You can change the `EXCHANGE_ID` variable in the configuration section of each script to your desired exchange (e.g., `binance`, `kraken`, `bybit`). Ensure you have the necessary API keys if the exchange requires them for historical data.

**Q: Why are there multiple backtesting scripts?**
A: Each script represents a different trading strategy or a different approach to backtesting. `backtest.py` is a custom-built backtester, while others leverage the `backtesting.py` library for a more standardized framework. This allows for exploration of various algorithmic ideas.

**Q: How can I interpret the backtest results?**
A: The scripts typically output performance statistics (e.g., total return, drawdown, win rate) and generate plots. The plots show the equity curve (how your capital grows or shrinks over time), trade entries and exits, and indicator overlays. Analyze these to understand the strategy's profitability, risk, and behavior. A higher total return and lower drawdown are generally desirable.
